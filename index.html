            <p>I am a prospective masters student of Solar Energy Engineering at Dalarna University and will be resuming in Autumn 2023. I want to develop expertise in electricity generation, with a focus on solar energy.
            I chose to study in Sweden because Sweden is quite remarkable when it comes to sustainability. This is evident in different technologies from fossil free steel to recycling to carbon capture, renewable energy energy, amongst others. In 2012 Sweden was able to achieve her 2020 target of being able to produce about 50% of it's electricity from renewable energy sources. I am keen to learning how the Swedes have been able to achieve this.
            For leisure, I enjoy watching and playing Basket ball, programming, and watching the news.
            I plan to use the knowledge gained and network built to provide solar energy solutions to Nigerian homes and businesses.
