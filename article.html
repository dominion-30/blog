   <h1>A to Z of submitting a potentially strong application at a Swedish University.</h1> 

   <p>The process of submitting a university application can seem daunting, but when done strategically, you increase your chances of success while also reducing the stress, and not becoming overwhelmed by the process. 
</p>
<h3>Required Document</h3>

read to the end, I have a bonus tip: 
<h4>1. Documents that are university independent</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>International passport</dt>
    <dd> This is a document issued by your home country that allows you to cross borders freely.(include pictures)</dd>

    <dt>Transcript</dt>
    <dd>
     This is a document issued by your university, stating your academic performances in different courses/subjects (include pictures)
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Degree Certificate
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This is a document issued by an academic institution attesting that the holder is qualified and has attained the said skills/proficiency on the document.
    </dd>

    <dt>
        English Certification
    </dt>
    <dd>
     This is a document attesting that the holder meets a certain requirement of English skills. It proofs that the holder can comfortably study using English Language as the language of instruction.
    </dd>

</dl>



<h4>
    2. Document that are program dependent
</h4>
<p>
    a. Swedish Universities usually have two types of requirements that must be met, if at all a potential application would succeed. They are: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
    <dt>General Entry Requirement</dt>
    <dd>This requirement ensures that the applicant's documents are equivalent to the Swedish Educational system. For example, a potential Bachelor's applicant needs to have completed and passed with certain grades at high school to meet the entry requirements. A Master's applicant, needs to have completed a first degree and obtained a certain honours to meet the entry requirements, usually, most Swedish Universities set this at Second class honours but you should confirm from your university.</dd>

    <dt>Specific Entry Requirement</dt>
    <dd>
        This requirement must also be met after meeting the general entry requirements. They usually involve the kind of degree obtained, European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) obtained in specified courses, different courses/disciple combinations, CV, amongst others</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Case Study</h4>
<div>
    <h4>University: Example University.</h4>
    <h5>Masters Program: Solar Energy Engineering.</h5>

    <dl>
        <dt>General Entry Requirements (GER)</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>At least a 180 ECTS Bachelors in (Physics or Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering)</li>
                <li>
                    Proficiency in English Language. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Specific Entry Requirement (SER)</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Video Statement</li>
                <li>10 ECTS in Electromagnetism</li>
                <li>10 ECTS in Object-Oriented Programming</li>
                <li>5 ECTS in Project-work</li>
                <li>20 ECTS portfolio</li>

            </ul>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    


    <blockquote>
        <b>Note</b>
        <p>
            <i>If I meet the GER and do not meet the SER, I would not get an admission for sure</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>If I meet the SER and do not meet the GER I would not get an admission for sure</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>If I meet the GER and the SER, my chances of being admitted have just increased.</i>
        </p>

    </blockquote>

</div>

<p>After meeting both the general and specific entry requirements, follow the steps below.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <dl>
            <dt>Create an account on <a href="https://universityadmissions.se">universityadmissions.se</a></dt>
            <dd>The next step is to create an account on <a href="https://www.universityadmissions.se/intl/createaccount">universityadmissions.se</a>. The application for the academic year in the following year usually opens around mid-October of the preceding year.The process of creating an account on universityadmissions.se is simple and straight forward. After creating your account, you can begin to make selections of programs. University Admissions is the body empowered by Swedish Law to handle admissions of international students. University Admissions allows applicants to make at least one selection and at most four selections. But with alternatives, come the problem of choice. University Admissions calls it <a href="https://universityadmissions.se/en/apply-to-masters/rank-your-selections-masters/"><q><i>Ranking of your selected programs</i></q></a>. Simply put, my first choice (i.e., the program I ranked first is considered first, taking into account the general entry requirements and the specific entry requirements, if after the considerations and I meet both requirements, I then attain a status of, <a href="https://universityadmissions.se/en/selection-and-admissions-results/reapplying/"><q><i>Qualified</i></q></a>, but if not, I attain a status of <q><i>Unqualified</i></q>). The same process is done for all of my selections i.e., second choice, third choice and fourth choice.
                <blockquote>

                <b>Note:</b>
                 You usually have from when the applications are open to about mid-January to make selections and modify them. Meaning if on December 24th of the preceding year of the proposed academic year, I had a selection of first choice A, second choice B, third choice C and fourth choice D. By January 1st of the following year, I can make a new selection of first choice X, second choice Y, third choice Z. Yes!, no fourth choice, not a mistake, just my new selection.

    </li>

    <li>
        <dl>
            <dt>Upload the supporting documents for your application on unversityadmissions.se</dt>
            <dd>These documents are university and program dependent. Any document specified by the university and the program are deemed supporting documents. They must be uploaded as at when due and the format and procedure for upload must also be taken into account. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                                CV of not more than two pages. So a 3 paged CV applicant is wrong. Remember you are competing for the slots at your university</li>
                            <li>

                                 Video Motivation Statement of not more than 90 Secs. Do not submit in MP4, use video sharing links like YouTube, Google Drive, amongst others
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>

                                Summary document, this usually contains a space for applicant's details, motivational letter, why you want to study at "your chosen" university, different course combinations and the number of ECTS you have in them, amongst others.
                
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                After the deadline for selection, you usually still have till the deadline for application fee payment to submit all supporting documents. If you meet all the requirements but fail to submit all the supporting documents, you might discover later, that the status of your application reads, <q><i>Unqualified</i></q>. The <q><i>Unqualified</i></q> status might be as a result of:

                <ul>
                    <li>Not meeting either of the general entry requirements or the specific entry requirements or</li>
                    <li>Not submitting(uploading) all the supporting documents.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <b>Note:</b>
                    Both General Entry Requirements, Specific Entry Requirements must be met and supporting documents submitted as at when due to attain the status of <q><i>Qualified</i></q>.
                </blockquote>

            </dt>
            <dd>University Admissions charges a 900 Sek non-waivable fee for non-EU/EEA citizens. For your application not to be termed late application which might affect you chances of admission, you should pay before the deadline, which is usually some weeks after mid-January (once the deadline for being able to modify your application elapses, pay your application fee, "make hay while the sun shines").

<p>
    <a href="https://universityadmissions.se/en/find-out-more/news-and-popular-topics/what-happens-between-application-and-admissions-results/">Now you are done and the waiting game begins.</a>
     In late March, the admission result, called  <q><i>Notification of Selection Results</i></q> are released by University Admissions on your portal/account. Here comes the bonus tip, I talked about earlier. Immediately you get admitted, before even posting on social media, look for the housing company your university has partnered with and register, so as to join the housing queue in other to secure your accommodation as the number of places available are usually less than the number of admitted students.
</p>


<h4>Rule of thumb:</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>Read and understand your program webpage and Universityadmissions.se</li>
    <li>Be strategic and timely with your application.</li>
    <li>When in doubt, mail your program director or international student office, they are willing to assist you with your study in Sweden Journey.</li>
 </ul>
